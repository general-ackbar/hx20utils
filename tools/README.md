Just a few AI generated python tools i used during the development process to test and verify wavefile
- **add_header.py** adds a 16-bit mono wav header to a bitstream
- **bit_time_tool.py** tries to calculate the byte offset in the payload from a given timestamp (not especially useful)
- **hx20_validate.py** validates a wav file
